Hi there, I'm Pieter De Knock 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!I am a strategic thinker with a long career in investments, asset management, and product & concept development. Today, I am diving deep into Artificial Intelligence, looking for creative crossovers between finance and AI to build tools and solutions that improve financial communication, decision-making, education,...


🚀 Current Focus

📌 Self-studying AI & Machine Learning, with a strong interest in business applications.

🤖 Building practical projects such as a personalized investment communication tool.

🔍 Exploring new ways to make finance more transparent, accessible, and responsible using technology.


🌐 Other projects

Besides finance & AI, I also run a passion project around vintage education wall charts:

🗺️ www.oudeschoolkaarten.be — An online store for old school maps and classroom posters.


📂 Featured Projects

AI Document Summarizer — A customizable document summarization tool for finance & beyond.

(More projects coming soon)
